## Set up your own fork of the argc-completions repository

1. [Fork the sigoden/argc-completions repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sigoden/argc-completions/fork).

This creates a personal remote repository that you can push to. This is needed because only argc-completions maintainers have push access to the main repositories.
